	abstract = {Abstract. Data scarcity and model over-parameterisation, leading to model equifinality and large prediction uncertainty, are common barriers to effective hydrological modelling. The problem can be alleviated by constraining the prior parameter space using parameter regionalization. A common basis for regionalization in the UK is the HOST database which provides estimates of hydrological indices for different soil classifications. In our study, Base Flow Index is estimated from the HOST database and the power of this index for constraining the parameter space is explored. The method is applied to a highly discretized distributed model of a 12.5 km2 upland catchment in Wales. To assess probabilistic predictions against flow observations, a probabilistic version of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency is derived. For six flow gauges with reliable data, this efficiency ranged between 0.70 and 0.81, and inspection of the results shows that the model explains the data well. Knowledge of how Base Flow Index and interception losses may change under future land use management interventions was then used to further condition the model. Two interventions are considered: afforestation of grazed areas, and soil degradation associated with increased grazing intensity. Afforestation leads to median reduction in modelled runoff volume of 24\% over the simulated 3 month period; and a median peak flow reduction ranging from 12–15\% over the six gauges for the largest simulated event. Uncertainty in all results is suprisingly low and it is concluded that using Base Flow Index estimated from HOST is a simple and potentially powerful method of conditioning the parameter space under current and future land management.},

	abstract = {Abstract. This paper describes the development of a semi-distributed conceptual rainfall–runoff model, originally formulated to simulate impacts of climate and land-use change on flood frequency. The model has component modules for soil moisture balance, drainage response and channel routing and is grid-based to allow direct incorporation of GIS- and Digital Terrain Model (DTM)-derived data sets into the initialisation of parameter values. Catchment runoff is derived from the aggregation of components of flow from the drainage module within each grid square and from total routed flow from all grid squares. Calibration is performed sequentially for the three modules using different objective functions for each stage. A key principle of the modelling system is the concept of nested calibration, which ensures that all flows simulated for points within a large catchment are spatially consistent. The modelling system is robust and has been applied successfully at different spatial scales to three large catchments in the UK, including comparison of observed and modelled flood frequency and flow duration curves, simulation of flows for uncalibrated catchments and identification of components of flow within a modelled hydrograph. The role of such a model in integrated catchment studies is outlined.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Probability Distributed Model, or PDM, has evolved as a toolkit of model functions that together constitute a lumped rainfall-runoff model capable of representing a variety of catchment-scale hydrological behaviours. Runoff production is represented as a saturation excess runoff process controlled by the absorption capacity (of the canopy, surface and soil) whose variability within the catchment is characterised by a probability density function of chosen form. Soil drainage to groundwater is controlled by the water content in excess of a tension threshold, optionally inhibited by the water content of the receiving groundwater store. Alternatively, a proportional split of runoff to fast (surface storage) and slow (groundwater) pathways can be invoked with no explicit soil drainage function. Recursive solutions to the Horton-Izzard equation are provided for routing flows through these pathways, conveniently considered to yield the surface runoff and baseflow components of the total flow. An alternative routing function employs a transfer function that is discretely-coincident to a cascade of two linear reservoirs in series. For real-time flow forecasting applications, the PDM is complemented by updating methods based on error prediction and state-correction approaches. The PDM has been widely applied throughout the world, both for operational and design purposes. This experience has allowed the PDM to evolve to its current form as a practical toolkit for rainfall-runoff modelling and forecasting.},

In all, ten model parameters have to be identified, seven of which have a major influence on the performance of the model.
            The model operates by accounting continuously for the moisture content in four different and mutually interrelated storages representing physical elements in the watershed.
            It has been applied to three different Danish watersheds. Several statistical measures of accuracy have been utilized for a quantitative evaluation of the simulation results.

	abstract = {Abstract. The core component of many hydrological systems, the moisture storage capacity available to vegetation, is impossible to observe directly at the catchment scale and is typically treated as a calibration parameter or obtained from a priori available soil characteristics combined with estimates of rooting depth. Often this parameter is considered to remain constant in time. Using long-term data (30–40 years) from three experimental catchments that underwent significant land cover change, we tested the hypotheses that: (1) the root-zone storage capacity significantly changes after deforestation, (2) changes in the root-zone storage capacity can to a large extent explain post-treatment changes to the hydrological regimes and that (3) a time-dynamic formulation of the root-zone storage can improve the performance of a hydrological model.A recently introduced method to estimate catchment-scale root-zone storage capacities based on climate data (i.e. observed rainfall and an estimate of transpiration) was used to reproduce the temporal evolution of root-zone storage capacity under change. Briefly, the maximum deficit that arises from the difference between cumulative daily precipitation and transpiration can be considered as a proxy for root-zone storage capacity. This value was compared to the value obtained from four different conceptual hydrological models that were calibrated for consecutive 2-year windows.It was found that water-balance-derived root-zone storage capacities were similar to the values obtained from calibration of the hydrological models. A sharp decline in root-zone storage capacity was observed after deforestation, followed by a gradual recovery, for two of the three catchments. Trend analysis suggested hydrological recovery periods between 5 and 13 years after deforestation. In a proof-of-concept analysis, one of the hydrological models was adapted to allow dynamically changing root-zone storage capacities, following the observed changes due to deforestation. Although the overall performance of the modified model did not considerably change, in 51 \% of all the evaluated hydrological signatures, considering all three catchments, improvements were observed when adding a time-variant representation of the root-zone storage to the model.In summary, it is shown that root-zone moisture storage capacities can be highly affected by deforestation and climatic influences and that a simple method exclusively based on climate data can not only provide robust, catchment-scale estimates of this critical parameter, but also reflect its time-dynamic behaviour after deforestation.},

	abstract = {Abstract. In many conceptual rainfall–runoff models, the water balance
differential equations are not explicitly formulated. These differential
equations are solved sequentially by splitting the equations into terms that
can be solved analytically with a technique called “operator splitting”. As
a result, only the solutions of the split equations are used to present the
different models. This article provides a methodology to make the governing
water balance equations of a bucket-type rainfall–runoff model explicit and
to solve them continuously. This is done by setting up a comprehensive
state-space representation of the model. By representing it in this way, the
operator splitting, which makes the structural analysis of the model more
complex, could be removed. In this state-space representation, the lag
functions (unit hydrographs), which are frequent in rainfall–runoff models
and make the resolution of the representation difficult, are first replaced
by a so-called “Nash cascade” and then solved with a robust numerical
integration technique. To illustrate this methodology, the GR4J model is
taken as an example. The substitution of the unit hydrographs with a Nash
cascade, even if it modifies the model behaviour when solved using operator
splitting, does not modify it when the state-space representation is solved
using an implicit integration technique. Indeed, the flow time series
simulated by the new representation of the model are very similar to those
simulated by the classic model. The use of a robust numerical technique that
approximates a continuous-time model also improves the lag parameter
consistency across time steps and provides a more time-consistent model with
time-independent parameters.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Heterogeneity and complexity of hydrological processes offer substantial challenges to the hydrological modeller. Some hydrologists try to tackle this problem by introducing more and more detail in their models, or by setting-up more and more complicated models starting from basic principles at the smallest possible level. As we know, this reductionist approach leads to ever higher levels of equifinality and predictive uncertainty. On the other hand, simple, lumped and parsimonious models may be too simple to be realistic or representative of the dominant hydrological processes. In this commentary, a new approach is proposed that tries to find the middle way between complex distributed and simple lumped modelling approaches. Here we try to find the right level of simplification while avoiding over-simplification. Paraphrasing Einstein, the maxim is: make a model as simple as possible, but not simpler than that. The approach presented is process based, but not physically based in the traditional sense. Instead, it is based on a conceptual representation of the dominant physical processes in certain key elements of the landscape. The essence of the approach is that the model structure is made dependent on a limited number of landscape classes in which the topography is the main driver, but which can include geological, geomorphological or land-use classification. These classes are then represented by lumped conceptual models that act in parallel. The advantage of this approach over a fully distributed conceptualisation is that it retains maximum simplicity while taking into account observable landscape characteristics.},

The model has been developed for climate change impact studies and has therefore a parsimonious structure; it requires three input times series - precipitation, temperature and potential evapotranspiration - and has 7 parameters to calibrate. A multi-signal approach considering daily discharge and - if available - annual glacier mass balance has been developed for the calibration of these parameters. The model has been calibrated for three different catchments in the Swiss Alps having glaciation rates between 37\% and 52\%. It simulates well the observed daily discharge, the hydrological regime and some basic glaciological features, such as the annual mass balance.},

The key concept of the model is the formulation of water transport by geomorphologic travel time distributions through gravity-driven transitions among geomorphic states: the mobilization of water (and possibly dissolved solutes) is simulated at the subcatchment scale and the resulting responses are convolved with the travel paths distribution within the river network to obtain the hydrologic response at the catchment outlet. The model thus breaks down the complexity of the hydrologic response into an explicit geomorphological combination of dominant spatial patterns of precipitation input and of hydrologic process controls. Nonstationarity and nonlinearity effects are tackled through soil moisture dynamics in the active soil layer. We present here the basic model set-up for precipitation–runoff simulation and a detailed discussion of its parameter estimation and of its performance for the Dischma River (Switzerland), a snow-dominated catchment with a small glacier cover.},

	abstract = {Usually the HBV model is calibrated by seeking one optimal parameter set that represents the catchment. From experience we know, however, that it is hardly possible to find an unique parameter set. This is because of errors in both the model structure and the observed variables and because of interactions between the different model parameters. Therefore, there may be many sets of parameters which give similar good results during a calibration period, but their predictions may differ when simulating runoff in the future. In this study a Monte Carlo procedure was used to assess the uncertainty of the parameter estimation and to describe differences in this uncertainty for the various parameters. A fuzzy measure of model goodness was introduced to allow combination of different objective functions. Only a few of the parameters were well-defined, whereas for most parameters good results could be obtained over large ranges. Tentatively an indication of the uncertainty in model predictions arising from the uncertainty in the parameterization was given by viewing the predictions of runoff during two periods.},

Different functionalities, such as an automatic calibration using a genetic algorithm or a Monte Carlo approach, as well as the possibility to perform batch runs with predefined model parameters make the software interesting especially for teaching in more advanced classes and research projects. Different teaching goals related to hydrological modeling are discussed and a series of exercises is suggested to reach these goals.},

Many existing hydrological modelling procedures do not make best use of available information, resulting in non-minimal uncertainties in model structure and parameters, and a lack of detailed information regarding model behaviour. A framework is required that balances the level of model complexity supported by the available data with the level of performance suitable for the desired application. Tools are needed that make optimal use of the information available in the data to identify model structure and parameters, and that allow a detailed analysis of model behaviour. This should result in appropriate levels of model complexity as a function of available data, hydrological system characteristics and modelling purpose. This paper introduces an analytical framework to achieve this, and tools to use within it, based on a multi-objective approach to model calibration and analysis. The utility of the framework is demonstrated with an example from the field of rainfall-runoff modelling.

	abstract = {Abstract. The goal of this paper is to explore the process controls underpinning regional patterns of variations of streamflow regime behavior, i.e., the mean seasonal variation of streamflow within the year, across the continental United States. The ultimate motivation is to use the resulting process understanding to generate insights into the physical controls of another signature of streamflow variability, namely the flow duration curve (FDC). The construction of the FDC removes the time dependence of flows. Thus in order to better understand the physical controls in regions that exhibit strong seasonal dependence, the regime curve (RC), which is closely connected to the FDC, is studied in this paper and later linked back to the FDC. To achieve these aims a top-down modeling approach is adopted; we start with a simple two-stage bucket model, which is systematically enhanced through addition of new processes on the basis of model performance assessment in relation to observations, using rainfall-runoff data from 197 United States catchments belonging to the MOPEX dataset. Exploration of dominant processes and the determination of required model complexity are carried out through model-based sensitivity analyses, guided by a performance metric. Results indicated systematic regional trends in dominant processes: snowmelt was a key process control in cold mountainous catchments in the north and north-west, whereas snowmelt and vegetation cover dynamics were key controls in the north-east; seasonal vegetation cover dynamics (phenology and interception) were important along the Appalachian mountain range in the east. A simple two-bucket model (with no other additions) was found to be adequate in warm humid catchments along the west coast and in the south-east, with both regions exhibiting strong seasonality, whereas much more complex models are needed in the dry south and south-west. Agricultural catchments in the mid-west were found to be difficult to predict with the use of simple lumped models, due to the strong influence of human activities. Overall, these process controls arose from general east-west (seasonality) and north-south (aridity, temperature) trends in climate (with some exceptions), compounded by complex dynamics of vegetation cover and to a less extent by landscape factors (soils, geology and topography).},
