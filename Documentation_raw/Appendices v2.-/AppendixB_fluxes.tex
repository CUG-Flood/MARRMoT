\chapter{Flux equations}
This appendix contains mathematical descriptions of all flux equations that are included in the Modular Assessment of Rainfall-Runoff Models Toolbox v2.- (MARRMoT).
For each flux equation, the mathematical constitutive function, as well as the MARRMoT code, which includes any necessary constraints, are given.
All fluxes are contained in Table \ref{tab:fluxesfunction}.
